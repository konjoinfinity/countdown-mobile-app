## Motivation

I wanted to create this project for practice, to learn, to challenge myself, to release to the appstores. Check out the video demo below.

## Tech/framework used
React Native Expo

<b>Built with</b>
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

## Features

The UI should include:
* A countdown screen with a timer for the selected event âœ…
* A button to add a new countdown event âœ…
* A list of all active countdown events âœ…

For an extra challenge:
* Allow users to view archives of past events âœ…
* Automatically trigger push notification reminders x days before each event ðŸŸ¨ (**planning**)
* Allow users to customize the look and feel of each event (i.e. choose a color scheme, add an emoji, or upload custom background images)âœ…
* Create an iOS or Android widget to show countdown timers on the userâ€™s home screen ðŸŸ¨ (**planning**)
